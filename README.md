# Commercial-Pricing-Revenue-Analysis-Excel-PowerBI-

This project analyses a retail company’s sales performance and pricing strategy to understand the drivers behind sustained financial losses. Using cleaned transactional sales data, I investigated the impact of aggressive discounting on revenue, demand, and contribution income, and assessed whether price elasticity could reliably inform pricing decisions. The project concludes with data-driven recommendations for restructuring the company’s discount strategy to restore profitability.
